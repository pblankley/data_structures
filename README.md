# data_structures
basic data structures:

I have a heap, linked list, binary search tree, hashtable and trie.

All structures are designed for readability and not necessarily performance.

I also include both efficient and inefficient sorting algorithms: 
Quicksort (single pivot),
Heap Sort, 
Merge Sort,
Insertion Sort,
Selection Sort and
Bubble Sort
